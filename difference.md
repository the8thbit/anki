# Differences with anki.
This files list the difference between regular anki and this forked
version. It also lists the different options in the Preferences's extra page.

## Keep seen card.
By default, this version of anki does not delete a card if it has
already been seen once. Because, it should probably not be empty, and
so you may want to repair the card type, to create the card again.

If checked, the option "Delete empty cards only if they are new" set
back «Empty cards» to its original meaning; it'll delete even the seen
cards.
