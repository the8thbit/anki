## Copy note (1566928056)
If you select notes in the browser, and do `Notes>Copy Notes` or
`Ctrl+Alt+C`, a copy of the notes are created.

You have two options in the preferences:
* "Preserve date of creation": keeps the «Created» value in the
  browser. It is particularly interesting if you review cards
  according to their creation date.
* "Preserve easyness, interval, due date, ...": this create a copy of
  each card, as close as possible to the original card. If you uncheck
  this, instead, your new cards will be fresh, and you'll start review
  from 0.
