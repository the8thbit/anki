Use multiple columns in the note editor. You can easily change the number of columns shown using the *Columns* field added by the add-on, and you can have a different number of columns for different note types and window types (browser, note adder, etc).

If you have any fields that take up a lot of space, you can configure them to take up an entire row.

## Why a second add-on

This is a great add-on by HSSM. For a few month, the author didn't
debug their code. They didn't take pull request into account. Thus I
update a new version, and I hope to keep this debugged. I'll delete
this if HSSM comes back and takes correction into account.

## Configuration
Using the add-on manager, you can change the setting of this
add-on.

## Warning
If you have downloaded Frozen Field add-on and disabled it, the result
may be different from what you expect.
