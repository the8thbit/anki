## Add/remove deck prefix (683170394)
In the browser, you can select cards, and then do `Decks > Add
prefix`, to add the same prefix to the deck name of all of those
cards. This ensure that they all belong to a same deck, while keeping
the same deck hierarchy. `Decks > Remove prefix` allows to remove this
common prefix and thus cancel the action `Add prefix`.
