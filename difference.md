## Changing a note type without synchronizing (719871418)
The preference "Change model without requiring a full sync" allow you
to avoid full sync after adding/removing a field or a card type to a
note type. However, this is risky. Thus you should only do this if you
are sure that the change on all devices are already
synchronized. Otherwise, it could create a bug.
