## Keeping note which have no cards (2018640062)
If you do «Empty cards», and a note has no more card, then you see a
warning, and the browser open to show you what notes have this
problem. You can thus correct them and avoid loosing the content of
their fields.

If you want to remove this feature, and have anki's default, uncheck
«Keep note without any card and warn» in the preferences.
