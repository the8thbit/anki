"""This module deals with decks and their configurations.

self.decks is the dictionnary associating an id to the deck with this id
self.dconf is the dictionnary associating an id to the dconf with this id

A deck is a dict composed of:
new/rev/lrnToday -- two number array.
            First one is currently unused
            The second one is equal to the number of cards seen today in this deck minus the number of new cards in custom study today.
 BEWARE, it's changed in anki.sched(v2).Scheduler._updateStats and anki.sched(v2).Scheduler._updateCutoff.update  but can't be found by grepping 'newToday', because it's instead written as type+"Today" with type which may be new/rev/lrnToday
timeToday -- two number array used somehow for custom study,  seems to be currently unused
conf -- (string) id of option group from dconf, or absent in dynamic decks
usn -- Update sequence number: used in same way as other usn vales in db
desc -- deck description, it is shown when cards are learned or reviewd
dyn -- 1 if dynamic (AKA filtered) deck,
collapsed -- true when deck is collapsed,
extendNew -- extended new card limit (for custom study). Potentially absent, only used in aqt/customstudy.py. By default 10
extendRev -- extended review card limit (for custom study), Potentially absent, only used in aqt/customstudy.py. By default 10.
name -- name of deck,
browserCollapsed -- true when deck collapsed in browser,
id -- deck ID (automatically generated long),
mod -- last modification time,
mid -- the model of the deck
"""



"""A configuration of deck is a dictionnary composed of:
name -- its name, including the parents, and the "::"




A configuration of deck (dconf) is composed of:
name -- its name
new -- The configuration for new cards, see below.
lapse -- The configuration for lapse cards, see below.
rev -- The configuration for review cards, see below.
maxTaken -- The number of seconds after which to stop the timer
timer -- whether timer should be shown (1) or not (0)
autoplay -- whether the audio associated to a question should be
played when the question is shown
replayq -- whether the audio associated to a question should be
played when the answer is shown
mod -- Last modification time
usn -- see USN documentation
dyn -- Whether this deck is dynamic. Not present in the default configurations
id -- deck ID (automatically generated long). Not present in the default configurations.

The configuration related to new cards is composed of:
delays -- The list of successive delay between the learning steps of
the new cards, as explained in the manual.
ints -- The delays according to the button pressed while leaving the
learning mode.
initial factor -- The initial ease factor
separate -- delay between answering Good on a card with no steps left, and seeing the card again. Seems to be unused in the code
order -- In which order new cards must be shown. NEW_CARDS_RANDOM = 0
and NEW_CARDS_DUE = 1
perDay -- Maximal number of new cards shown per day
bury -- Whether to bury cards related to new cards answered

The configuration related to lapses card is composed of:
delays -- The delays between each relearning while the card is lapsed,
as in the manual
mult -- percent by which to multiply the current interval when a card
goes has lapsed
minInt -- a lower limit to the new interval after a leech
leechFails -- the number of lapses authorized before doing leechAction
leechAction -- What to do to leech cards. 0 for suspend, 1 for
mark. Numbers according to the order in which the choices appear in
aqt/dconf.ui


The configuration related to review card is composed of:
perDay -- Numbers of cards to review per day
ease4 -- the number to add to the easyness when the easy button is
pressed
fuzz -- The new interval is multiplied by a random number between
-fuzz and fuzz
minSpace -- not currently used
ivlFct -- multiplication factor applied to the intervals Anki
generates
maxIvl -- the maximal interval for review
bury -- If True, when a review card is answered, the related cards of
its notes are buried
