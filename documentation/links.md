Here are link to other nice documentation I found.

# Anki droid
Ankidroid has a nice wiki, explaining many things. Not always up to
date. If I find some informations which fits in this wiki, I'll write
it in their wiki instead of this folder.

In particular, they document most of the database structure, even if
some parts are still not clear.
