# Differences with anki.
This files list the difference between regular anki and this forked
version. It also lists the different options in the Preferences's extra page.

## Long term back-up (529955533)
Ensure that there are both a lot of recent back-up, and one backup by
day for the last month, one by month for the last year, and one by
year. So that you can recover some old part of your collection.

This can be deactivated from the back-up tab of the preferences window.
